| #8904 | [ allow using basic auth to connecting to registry ](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/8904)| Comment |@dmp42 comments: "Basic authentication is already supported - @13W can you comment on what this is doing / adding on top of the existing functionality?" |
| #6190 | [devmapper: use 'user_xattr' as mountoption for ext4 - fixes](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/6190) | Assigned  |  @unclejack was assigned by @crosbymichael an hour ago |
| #8851 | [Use Syscall.Tcgetattr and Syscall.Tcsetattr of GCCGO when available](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/8851) | Closed | Issue folded into overall high-level tracker of features required for unofficial gccgo support: [#9207](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/9207). @crosbymichael comments: “LGTM; We would like for someone to contribute a make.sh target to build the binary with gccgo inside our main Dockerfile before we merge anymore gccgo changes."|
| #9060 | [Make 'docker push' faster at the small expense of extra registry disk space](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/9060) | Closed | @crosbymichael comments: "We think this needs to be configurable but needs a proposal first. This may fix your issue with CPU load because you have faster bandwidth. However, someone running docker with larger CPUs and lower bandwidth will be hurt by this change. Could you please open a proposal if you would like to have this setting configurable so that we can discuss before making code changes? Thanks!” |
| #9019 | [Man page amendments](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/9019) | Closed | @crosbymichael comments: “LGTM”; @svendowideit comments: "will rebase and take care of it" (replaced by [#9272](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/9272))|
| #9075 | [go-md2man and its dependencies vendored](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/9075) | Closed | @svendowideit comments:  "We'd prefer to move the docs build into a make.sh step, and move the docs build into a Dockerfile. We'll close this, and would be happy to see work done on the merging of the docs build into the main build workflow.” |
| #8919 | [Fix create container output messages when the image is not existed locally](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/8919) | Closed | @jfrazelle comments: "closed for [#9270](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/9270) thanks for being patient sorry about that, I used your commit and modified a bit :)” |
|#8803 |[Do not create new volumes on build:](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/8803) | Closed | @crosbymichael comments:  "As we discussed in the meeting, this requires more discussion as it really changes the semantics of the Dockerfile if we do something like this. It really is a design discussion about deferring volume creation until runtime and not at buildtime. As for the implementation in this PR, adding this to config is not going to work as it's committed to the image. I'll close this PR for now so that we can discussion volume deferral in a design session.” |
