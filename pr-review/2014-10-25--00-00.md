# First PR Review Meeting

### ENV variables substitution

**references [issue #2637](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/2637#issuecomment-60344600)**

- we merged patch that allows ENV variable to be substituted, so now if users wanted those to be evaluated from the shell, errors occur
- option 1: whitelist/blacklist certain commands from substitution
    - patch for this: https://gist.github.com/erikh/2cd90a4361a5b4679a1f
    - will lead to inconsistencies, cause issues down the road with "well this command does this, so the other commands should do"
- option 2: add escaping, behavior like shell scripts (escaping variables)
    - would need really good escaping
    - escaping is broken now
    - if we roll out support for this new escaping, we will have to support it, which leads to problems down the road with docker versions and building all files
- option 3: revert

**DECISION**: @erikh will implement whitelisting, fix escape swalling, and document variable substitution in Dockerfile


### gh#8348 [Add container modification API and cli](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/8348)

- use case dynamically attaching volumes devices
- UI
    - decision is made on making everything singular
    - should device be a top level command?
        - discussion on other things we may want to modify on the fly, resize, change SELinux labels, add interface, links
    - compared to [ip](http://linux.die.net/man/8/ip)
    - whatever we decide, needs to support devmapper resize
    - should it be `set`?
- we need to discuss the UI on dynamic actions on a container
- @cpuguy's PR for volume as a top level command is brought up, as having a similar UI design but for a top level command *not* container modification CLI [gh#8484](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/8484)

**DECISION**: 

> "..we feel this requires making a wider UI decision - it may be a small change but it happens to be the first of a while new class of interactions (namely dynamic changes to a container). Lots of use cases and opinions out there."

### gh#8406 [Add support file name with whitespace for ADD and COPY command](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/8406)

- solves problem with filenames with whitespace [#8318](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/8318)
- do we want to plan to get rid of JSON mode at some point?
    - all agree yes
    - will this effect, getting rid of JSON at some point?
        - @erikh says no
    - can we do a sprint for a week and find good quote handling so we can get rid of JSON
        - we need to introduce Dockerfile versioning before any of that
- needs to be well documented so we avoid people trying `[ "dir", "subdir", "subdir" ]`

**DECISION**: Design LGTM from @shykes, but we need to work on good quote handling [link to comments on PR](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/8406#issuecomment-60465363)


### gh#8761 [Proposal: Use logrus as logging framework for docker](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/8761)

- Fixes inconsistencies with logs
- options to dump logs as JSON
- what is impact on the user?:
    - log output format would change
    - improved log output for visibility and parsing
- not in this proposal, *if* the user wants to change the format to say JSON, etc, there could exist a flag for doing so
    - but this can be done in a separate proposal

**DECISION**: All are for the new log package


### gh#8697 [DNS Service Package](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/8697)

- adds a vendored package and a DNS package
- the code is not actually being used, so do we merge it?
- is merging something that is not complete, make us tied to this implementation

**DECISION**: should move to a separate repo, and wait for it to be used before merging it in, maybe find a small feature to add it to before using on links, maybe something like (https://github.com/tianon/rawdns)
