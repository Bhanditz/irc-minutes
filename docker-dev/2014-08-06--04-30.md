# 23Jul2014 Asia-Pacific TZ irc meeting.

#docker-dev meetings are held twice a week in the #docker-dev irc group on Freenode.
This irc channel is logged all the time, so you can always [refer to it](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/).

Held at [2:30pm Wednesday, Brisbane time]().

Please remember that there are now 2 meetings, this one, and the one in the SF timezone.

# [as an experiment we're considering dropping the frequency of the (primary) contributor meeting to 1/month]()

to give us some breathing space to focus more on PRs and issues, make things more async etc

# [we'll also be experimenting for the next week with a lighter LGTM rule: only 1 LGTM required per subsystem, instead of majority]()

There was quite a bit of discussion after last week's meeting - see https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/18953120/

# [docker pull / push slow #7291 (sammcj)]()

# [a continuation of the bind mount support in boot2docker discussion]()

# [Boot2Docker will switch to using TLS socket in 1.2.0]()

# [EOM](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/18484306/)
