# 01Aug2014 Asia-Pacific TZ irc meeting.

#docker-dev meetings are held twice a week in the #docker-dev irc group on Freenode.
This irc channel is logged all the time, so you can always [refer to it](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/).

Held at [2:30pm Wednesday, Brisbane time](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/18848843/).

Please remember that there are now 2 meetings, this one, and the one in the SF timezone.

# [boot2docker OSX and Windows filesystem bind mounts](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/18848864/)

- [automatically mount home directory](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker-cli/issues/202)
- [Proposal: Remote Shared Volumes](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/7249)

A few of us discussed a safe and portable way to auto-configure sharing from a client system to
a remote Docker daemon - with Boot2Docker used as an example where we have quite a lot of control
of both sides.

I noted that I'm very reluctant to auto-share the user's HOME dir, as that will give rogue containers
way too much access to the user's computer.

We worked through some options and ended up at a similar place to @vieux's Proposal above, but with 
added abstraction, and Docker daemon configuration.

the general idea is:

1. Boot2Docker creates a Shared folder on the client computer `~/docker-share`, into which a user will put files
2. Boot2Docker starts the VM, and tells it that there is a share at `//192.168.59.3/docker-share`
3. the Docker daemon is started, with some config that tells it that there is a volume-base alias `/data` that mapps to `cifs://192.168.59.103/docker-share:user:sven,password:blag,uid:100,ntlmsso:secure,many:othe,options:true`
4. then the user can use that share using a syntax like `docker run -v /data/project:/code something`

I need to write a Proposal for it, and will update the minutes when I get there.

Over the following week, more ideas have been talked about in the PR that sparked boot2docker-cli#202

The plan is to deliver something that allows desktop FS sharing for 1.3.0

# [topic# allow /etc/hosts /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/hostname to be changed #5129](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/18850263/)

- [allow /etc/hosts /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/hostname to be changed](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/5129)

Short discussion about the PR, it looks like it is waiting for @crosbymichael.
