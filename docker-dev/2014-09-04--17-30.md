# US TZ irc meeting.

#docker-dev meetings are held twice a month in the #docker-dev irc group on Freenode.
This irc channel is logged all the time, so you can always [refer to it](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/).

Held at [10:30am Thursday, San Francisco time](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/21024305/).

Please remember that there are now 2 meetings, one in an Asia-Pacific timezone, and this one in the SF timezone.

# [gh#7667 - remote API auth proposal (dmcg_)](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/21024415/)

- https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/7667

we are trying to make secure connections mandatory using TLS but in a way that feels more like sharing SSH keys rather than TLS certificates
the core of the change involves every client an daemon having a public private key pair which uniquely identifies the user/process
and those key pairs are used to generate TLS certificates which identify the client and server to each other
the client and servers maintain a list of keys in which they trust which is used to verify the TLS certificates, rather than a traditional CA
existing CAs will still work in additional to this method
that is the short summary, the longer summary is in the issue

See the irc log for more discussion.

# [user namespaces (dineshs)](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/21028602/)

- https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=8447
- https://github.com/docker/libcontainer/pull/5

it seems that docker support for user namespaces is blocked by libcontainer support, which in turn is blocked by Go issues
wanted to check with folks if it makes sense to continue with lxc support in the mean time
if there are no objections to that, we could potentially discuss lxc-based user namespace support in more detail

see [Support for user namespaces](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/4572) for
some further information on the proposal.
