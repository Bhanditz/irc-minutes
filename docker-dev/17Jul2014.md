# First Asia-Pacific TZ irc meeting.

#docker-dev meetings are held twice a week in the #docker-dev irc group on Freenode.
This irc channel is logged all the time, so you can always [refer to it](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/).

Initially held at [3:30pm Thursday, Brisbane time](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/18158465/).

Please remember that there are now 2 meetings, this one, and the one in the SF timezone.

# [Tweak the meeting timing](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/18158475/)

SvenDowideit proposed to move the meeting to 37 hours before the SF meeting:
- 4:30 am Wednesday UTC
- 2:30 pm Wednesday in Brisbane
- 4:30 pm Wednesday in New Zealand
- 12:30 pm Wednesday in Singapore
- 10:00 am Wednesday in India
- 8:30 pm Tuesday in San Francisco

# [Docker logging proposal](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/18158621/)

silaris indicated an interest in getting some action on [better logging](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/docker-dev/3paGTWD6xyw) support

We probably need to make a more formal set of proposals so they can be discussed.

# [ARM64 port](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/18158876/)

mwhudson is working towards [Docker support for ARM64](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/docker-dev/71vuKZpqvyU).

So we had a quick discussion of some of the needed work
- Docker images need to use Arch
- the Docker daemon and client need to be able to filter by arch
- Docker registry and Hub support for multliple arch
- boot2docker support to enable testing and development

# [FROM chaining PR](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/18159073/)

lk4d4 asked about [PR#4954](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/pull/4954), as its been sitting and waiting.

I suggested that for now, its going to be more effective to ask in the next meeting. I intended to get it added to the agenda - I think I missed it :/.

# [API Documentation](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/18159258/)

I asked if there was something we could do to progress with the API docs, and recveived quite a few good suggestions and expressions of interest. I'll follow up on those in the coming weeks.

Big point being that we need to iterate something, as its not moving forward atm.
