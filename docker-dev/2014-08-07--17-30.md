# US TZ irc meeting.

#docker-dev meetings are held twice a week in the #docker-dev irc group on Freenode.
This irc channel is logged all the time, so you can always [refer to it](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/).

Held at [10:30am Thursday, San Francisco time](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/19323770/).

Please remember that there are now 2 meetings, one in an Asia-Pacific timezone, and this one in the SF timezone.

# [trying a monthly meeting format (shykes)](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/19323797/)

To scale this sysem we need to gradually step away from mandatory synchronous meetings as a primary tool
I would like to experiment with monthly

The goal is to give everyone, especially maintainers, some breathing space to do things with more signal/noise ratio, like reviewing design props and PRs, short onthefly irc sync, and of course writing code :)

Also we should clearly designate the meeting as "non-binding". It's an opportunity to discuss
But not where important decisions are taken - that's always in the repo

# [gh#7374 - revert --stop/--kill and use --timeout instead (cpuguy83)](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/19325062/)

- [Revert --stop/--kill and use --timeout instead](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/7374)

cpuguy83 is really concerned that we got rid of "rm -f" too hastily, and that we have a short window here before 1.2.0 to change this

so I'd just ask that maintainers take a look and weigh in whether they think "rm -f" or "rm --stop" / "rm --kill" are a better UI / UX ;)

-f is gone today; deprecated
there needs to be some context here
`docker rm -f` is super slow if you have a lot of containers
because it is trying to stop and not kill

anyway, after some discussion on the issue
we agreed we would introduce -s for stop and -k for kill and deprecate -f, in order to be more explicit
and the PR got merged
it's not in a release yet, but it's in master

also, --timeout is like -t in docker stop
and in restart

i think the wisest thing to do right now is to revert the -s and -k change
and not introduce --timeout
- tianon: I'm +1 to reverting the change too, and I'm also -1 on --timeout

- erikh: we currently send STOP, wait 10 or 15 seconds, then send KILL
- lk4d4: we can try to send sigterm and sigkill without timeout
- erikh: ^ is what I was after.
