# 23Jul2014 Asia-Pacific TZ irc meeting.

#docker-dev meetings are held twice a week in the #docker-dev irc group on Freenode.
This irc channel is logged all the time, so you can always [refer to it](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/).

Held at [2:30pm Wednesday, Brisbane time](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/18483493/).

Please remember that there are now 2 meetings, this one, and the one in the SF timezone.

Working offline to get some documentation ironed out

# [PR: Docker containers can conflict with users on host system in Linux 3.15](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/18483592/)

[PR: Docker containers can conflict with users on host system in Linux 3.15](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/issues/6345)

`larsks` did some very detailed analysis of the problem, finding out that turning on `CONFIG_AUDIT` then triggers new `CAP_AUDIT_WRITE` restrictions in 3.15.

We have a resolution to the issue in [Add AUDIT_WRITE cap #7179](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/pull/7179).

# [Please test the 1.1.2 beta release](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/18484063/)

Please test docker 1.1.2:
* Ubuntu/Debian: https://test.docker.io/ubuntu or curl -sSL https://test.docker.io/ | sh
* Linux 64bit binary: https://test.docker.io/builds/Linux/x86_64/dock...
* Darwin/OSX 64bit client binary: https://test.docker.io/builds/Darwin/x86_64/doc...

# [is anyone interested in us making RPM releases too](https://botbot.me/freenode/docker-dev/msg/18484114/)

I wondered if the Docker project should also make RPM releases - so users can test beta releases.

We would base it on the existing Centos package, unless a better idea comes along.

`larsks` indicated that he would be interested, and so he and I (and tianon) will probably co-ordinate something
over the coming weeks - feel free to help :)
